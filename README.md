# Minimalistic Hardware Emulator

This is a Hardware Emulation Platform with minimal hardware description support. The emulator works on a Hardware Description Language (HDL). You can write the HDL Program and click on the Run button. The emulator builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and the runs it. It also generates a truth table with all the possible binary combinations of the inputs as mentioned in the File.

**N.B:** The emulator is not optimized and can only be used for education purpose. Some Good to Have Features are yet to be implemented. Check the 'Pending Features' section.

## Pending Features

Below is the list of features that would be beneficial to the projects but I could not implement them due to lack of time.

- Edit not saved icon
- On Double click of chip
- File rename
